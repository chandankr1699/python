    "Q1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Guido Van Rossum\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Which type of programming does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with Identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e, it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently.\n",
    "This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "We must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is correct extension of python file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. (a) .py is correct extension of python file.\n",
    "(b) .pynb (interactive python notebook) is extension for jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Is Python Code Compiled or Interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is an Interpreted Language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the python virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Name a few block of code used to define in python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Indentation is used to define a block of code in python.\n",
    "Braces{} are used to define a block of code in most programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. State the character used to give single line comments in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The character '#'\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Mention Funtions which can help us find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.(1) Using sys.version method\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "    print(\"User Current Version:-\",  sys.version)\n",
    "    \n",
    "(2). Using python_version() function \n",
    "from platform import python_version\n",
    "print(\"Current Python Version-\", python_version())\n",
    "\n",
    "(3). Using python-V command \n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using construct called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \"lambda\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What does PIP stand for in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Preferred Installer Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Mention a few Built in functions in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. print() function\n",
    "     type() function\n",
    "     input() function\n",
    "     dir() function\n",
    "     max() function\n",
    "     help() function\n",
    "     \n",
    "Q12. What is maximum possible length of an identifier in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 79 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What are benefits of using python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. (a) Third-Party Modules\n",
    "     (b) Presence of libraries\n",
    "     (c) User-Friendly data structure\n",
    "     \n",
    "Q14. How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Memory management in python involves the management of a private heap. A private heap is a portion of memory that is exclusive to the python process. All python objects and data structures are stored in the private heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indetation in python is very important.\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
